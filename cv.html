                <p>Hey! I’m Owen, a designer with a curious mind and a passion for hands-on problem-solving. I believe that good design can create ripple effects of positive change in people's lives. </p>
                <p>For me, design is more than just creating aesthetically pleasing objects or interfaces; it's a journey of exploration with users, a process of uncovering problems and seeking solutions. I enjoy immersing myself in the user's world, understanding their desires, challenges, and unmet needs, and using design thinking to transform those insights into meaningful solutions. </p>
                <p>Over the past few years, I've been fortunate enough to participate in a variety of design projects, from physical products to digital interfaces and even broader service design initiatives. These experiences have taught me that design is not merely an individual act of creation but rather a dialogue with team members, users, and even society as a whole. </p>
                <p>I embrace challenges and am committed to continuous learning, eager to use design to craft compelling narratives for the world.</p>

                    <h4>Design Philosophy</h4>
                </div>
                <p>My design journey is a continuous exploration of the relationship between "people" and "design." I firmly believe that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Design begins with "people": </span>I always place the user at the heart of the design process, striving to understand and empathize with their needs and emotions.</li>
                    <li><span>Design is a process of "exploration": </span>I enjoy employing various research methods to uncover underlying problems and identify innovative design opportunities.</li>
                    <li><span>Design results in a "story": </span>My aim is for my designs to be more than just tools for problem-solving; I want them to resonate with users and enrich their lives.</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>My design career began at Quan Yi Tong Enterprise, where I was responsible for designing <span>advertisements, posters, and brochures</span> and participated in the establishment of <span>brand identity systems</span>. This experience taught me how to effectively use visual design to communicate core brand values and sparked my interest in <span>researching design trends and new technologies</span> to enhance the innovation and competitiveness of my designs. More importantly, I learned how to effectively <span>communicate with clients</span>, gain a deep understanding of their design needs, and provide professional design advice. Through my involvement in the growth of numerous brands, from establishing their brand image to designing their physical spaces, I came to realize that design is not just about visual presentation but also about <span>problem-solving and value creation</span>. This realization laid a solid foundation for my future design endeavors.</p>

                        <p>2022 - 2024</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>At Vernal Manufacturing & Engineering, my role expanded to encompass <span>product development, project management, and UI/UX design</span>. I began to <span>lead product development projects</span>, taking charge of every stage from market research and user research to product specification definition, prototyping, and testing. This experience taught me how to <span>coordinate cross-functional teams</span> and ensure that projects were completed on schedule and met their objectives. Using <span>3D modeling software</span>, I transformed design concepts into tangible product prototypes and continuously refined the designs to enhance their commercial value and user satisfaction. Additionally, I <span>led and participated in the design of the company's official website UI/UX</span>, applying user-centered design principles to digital products and creating a positive online experience.</p>
                    <p>During my time at Vernal, I had the privilege of leading two significant projects as the Project Manager:</p>
                    <p>In “Self-Created Storage Brand and Marketing Plan” project, I was responsible for planning and executing everything from <span>brand positioning and product design to marketing strategies</span>. I <span>conducted market research and user research</span> to gain a deep understanding of the target audience's needs and preferences, and I translated those insights into concrete design directions. I <span>collaborated with a design agency</span> to create a series of innovative and practical storage products that aligned with the brand's image. To successfully introduce the brand to the target market, I <span>developed a variety of marketing campaigns</span> and closely monitored project progress to ensure everything went smoothly and achieved the desired business outcomes. Notably, after user testing, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback and users indicated a willingness to pay prices in line with our projections, validating the market potential of the design.</p>
                    <p>In “Design Innovation for Manufacturing Industry Clusters” project, I led a <span>cross-disciplinary team</span> (comprising UX researchers, designers, and manufacturing experts) to drive innovation in the manufacturing sector. I <span>employed user research methodologies</span> to gain a deep understanding of the needs and pain points of manufacturers and translated those insights into design opportunities. Through <span>innovative product designs and business models</span>, we helped manufacturers enhance their product competitiveness and market value. This challenging yet rewarding project allowed me to learn how to effectively coordinate professionals from different fields and work collaboratively towards a common goal. As a result of our efforts, manufacturers adopted new product development and production processes, leading to significant positive changes in the industry.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I am working as an Industrial Designer at the Plastic Industry Development Center. Here, I continue to deepen my expertise in product design, responsible for the <span>ideation, sketching, and 3D modeling</span> of products, and I collaborate closely with engineers to transform design concepts into viable products. I strive to make designs not only aesthetically pleasing but also <span>user-friendly and intuitive</span>, creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience. I am also involved in <span>UI/UX design</span>, learning how to apply user research methods to design fluid and easy-to-navigate digital interfaces. During my time here, I have participated in numerous projects, including the development of a smart foot examination system for diabetic patients, a menstrual cup and insertion device, a light-stimulation-based acupuncture device, a microneedle patch applicator, a kidney stone urine analyzer, a plasma device for agricultural use, and a catheter mold tooling development project, continuously expanding my design horizons and skill set.</p>
